This Mini Project is part of Course 6, HarvardX+PH125.6x-Data Wrangling form the Harvard Data Science Professional program.

This Repository contains a basic project performing data extraction and preliminary analysis from a pdf report titled:"RD-Mortality-Report_2015-18-180531.pdf" included in the "dslabs" package.

On September 20, 2017, Hurricane María made landfall on Puerto Rico. It was the worst natural disaster on record in Puerto Rico and the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since 2004. However, Puerto Rico's official death statistics only tallied 64 deaths caused directly by the hurricane (due to structural collapse, debris, floods and drownings), an undercount that slowed disaster recovery funding. The majority of the deaths resulted from infrastructure damage that made it difficult to access resources like clean food, water, power, healthcare and communications in the months after the disaster, and although these deaths were due to effects of the hurricane, they were not initially counted.

In order to correct the misconception that few lives were lost in Hurricane María, statisticians analyzed how death rates in Puerto Rico changed after the hurricane and estimated the excess number of deaths likely caused by the storm.The [analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16X9qtnPaD--2dPhpcwu7S53esafH59i9/preview) by the Milken Institute School of Public Health suggested that the actual number of deaths in Puerto Rico was 2,975 (95% CI: 2,658-3,290) over the 4 months following the hurricane, much higher than the original count.

We extract actual daily mortality data from Puerto Rico and investigate whether the Hurricane María had an immediate effect on daily mortality compared to unaffected days in September 2015-2017.
